This workspace compiles the projects and features I've developed as part of my self-taught JavaScript training through various online courses.

### :page_with_curl: About the project:
The repository includes an index.html file, which contains the main structure of the web interface, along with its corresponding CSS style file. It also includes a JavaScript file that organizes all the exercises developed.
It's important to note that the JavaScript code is structured into modules, with the goal of clearly dividing functions, making them easier to understand and maintain, and promoting a practical and organized approach to learning.
